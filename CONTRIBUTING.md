## Our House Rules

We've got a Code of Conduct that everyone's gotta follow. Be cool, be kind, and if you see any funny business, give us a shout at indrit.zeqiri@gmail.com

## How You Can Help

### Spotted a Bug?

If you've found something wonky, here's what to do:

- Give your issue a clear title that explains what's up.
- Walk us through how to see the bug in action.
- If you can, show us some examples.

### Got a Cool Idea?

Thought of a way to make ZARK-WAF Core even more awesome? Sweet! Here's how to let us know:

- Come up with a title that sums up your idea.
- Break down your suggestion step-by-step.
- Throw in some examples if you can.

### Ready to Write Some Code?

Not sure where to start? No sweat! Check out these issues:

- Beginner-friendly stuff - just a few lines of code and maybe a test or two.
- Help wanted - a bit meatier than the beginner issues.

### Submitting Your Work

When you're ready to show us what you've done:

- Fill out our PR template
- Don't put issue numbers in the PR title
- Follow our Rust style guide
- Write clear, helpful Rust doc comments
- End your files with a newline (it's just good manners)

## How We Roll

### Git Commit Messages

- Write like you're telling someone what to do ("Add feature", not "Added feature")
- Keep the first line short and sweet (72 characters max)
- After that first line, go wild with references to issues and PRs

### Rust Style

We're pretty chill, but we do have some ground rules:

- Run cargo fmt before you commit (keeps everything tidy)
- Give cargo clippy a whirl to catch any oopsies

### Writing Docs

- Markdown is our jam
- When you're talking about code, use these fancy brackets:
    - Classes: {ClassName}
    - Instance methods: {ClassName::methodName}
    - Class methods: {ClassName.methodName}

## One More Thing

We use labels to keep our issues and PRs organized:

* bug - Oops, something's not right
* enhancement - New shiny things
* documentation - For all the wordsmiths out there
* good first issue - Perfect for newbies
